# PreProd Satisfaction poll

In the Cardano [PrepProd testnet](https://book.world.dev.cardano.org/environments.html#pre-production-testnet) there is the transaction with the ID

```d8c1b1d871a27d74fbddfa16d28ce38288411a75c5d3561bb74066bcd54689e2``` 

which acts as the first test run in epoch 67 (01 - 05 May 2023)

The question asked in legible plain text is:

```
How satisfied are you with the current rewards and incentives scheme?
[0] dissatisfied
[1] no opinion
[2] satisfied
```

How to participate as a PreProd Stake Pool Operator is described [here](../../../readme.md)
